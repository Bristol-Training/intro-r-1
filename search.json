Seing R errors (also sometimes called exceptions) is not a sign that you’re a bad programmer or that you’re doing something terrible. Even experienced programmers see R errors on their screen.\nError messages are in fact a very useful feedback mechanism for the programmer but that can be a bit daunting when you first see them. Let’s recreate a typical error message: a dataframe with three columns will not have a column at index 6 (the highest index in that case would be 3) and produce an error if we ask for it.\n\n\n\ndataframe.R\n\ndf &lt;- data.frame(\n  name = c(\"Jean\", \"Thomas\", \"Daniel\"),\n  age = c(25, 30, 35),\n  is_student = c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)\n)\n\ncat(df[,6])\n\n\nError in `[.data.frame`(df, , 6): undefined columns selected\n\n\nLikewise, it will return an error if there’s no matching column name.\n\ncat(df[,\"Will\"])\n\nError in `[.data.frame`(df, , \"Will\"): undefined columns selected\n\n\nIn this last case, has two parts to it. The first is the words before the colon which tells you where the error was found. The second part of that line is usually a slightly more descriptive message, in this case telling us that the specific problem was that the column selected is not known.\nTake your time to read the error messages when they are printied to the screen, they will most likely help you solve the issue. If you think that you’ve fixed the problem but the error persists, make sure that you’ve saved the script file and rerun your code afterwards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nWhat happens if you try to print df[12,6]in the above example?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen trying to access individual elements, R returns an empty object but not an error.\n\ncat(df[12,6])",

Once it’s matched one, it will not bother checking to see if any of those later on would have matched. This means that you should order your questions from most-specific to least-specific.\nFor example, if you want to do one thing for positive numbers, but something special instead for numbers greater than 100, then you should put the more specific check first:\n\nmy_number &lt;- 73\n\nif (my_number &gt; 100) {\n    cat(my_number, \"is large\")\n} else if ( my_number &gt; 1) {\n    cat(my_number, \"is positive\")\n} else {\n    cat(my_number, \"negative\")\n}\n\n73 is positive\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nCreate a file leap_year.R which calculates, for a given year, whether it is a leap year and prints out the answer. You might want to read the year in using input, or you could hard-code it in the program.\nThe rules to follow are:\n\nif the year is divisible by 400 then it’s a leap year,\notherwise, if the year is divisible by 100 then it’s not,\notherwise, if the year is divisible by 4 then it’s a leap year,\notherwise, it’s not.\n\nTo simplify the writing of the program, you might find it easier to start with the divisible-by-4 condition, then add in the divisible-by-100 check and then add in the divisible-by-400 calculation.\nFor reference, here are some years for you to check against:\n\n2023 - not a leap year as it’s not divisible by 4\n2024 - a leap year as it’s divisible by 4 (and not by 100)\n1900 - not a leap year as it’s divisible by 100 (and not by 400)\n2000 - a leap year as it’s divisible by 400\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nWhenever solving a problem like this, it’s always good to build it up one step at a time. You could be tempted to jump right to the solution but it is easier to take small steps and check your results along the way than debugging a long piece of code.\n\nDivisible by 4\nThe first step is to implement the simplest of the logical checks: is the year divisible by 4? If it is, print out an appropriate message checking that it works for a know leap year.\n\n\n\nleap_year.r\n\nyear &lt;- 2024\n\nif (year %% 4 == 0) {\n    cat(year, \"is a leap year\")\n}\n\n\n2024 is a leap year\n\n\nFor a year that we know is not a leap year, what do we get:\n\n\n\nleap_year.r\n\nyear &lt;- 2023\n\nif (year %% 4 == 0) {\n    cat(year, \"is a leap year\")\n}\n\n\nWe get no output, so let’s fix that next, by adding an else:\n\n\n\nleap_year.r\n\nyear &lt;- 2024\n\nif (year %% 4 == 0) {\n    cat(year, \"is a leap year\")\n} else {\n    cat(year, \"is not a leap year\")\n}\n\n\n2024 is a leap year\n\n\n\n\n\nleap_year.r\n\nyear &lt;- 2023\n\nif (year %% 4 == 0) {\n    cat(year, \"is a leap year\")\n} else {\n    cat(year, \"is not a leap year\")\n}\n\n\n2023 is not a leap year\n\n\nSo far it’s looking like it’s doing the right thing. We have a working leap year calculator which covers most cases correctly.\n\n\nDivisible by 100\nLet’s check the next corner case: what happens if the year is divisible by 100. The rules say that this should not be a leap year:\n\n\n\nleap_year.r\n\nyear &lt;- 1900\n\nif (year %% 4 == 0) {\n    cat(year, \"is a leap year\")\n} else {\n    cat(year, \"is not a leap year\")\n}\n\n\n1900 is a leap year\n\n\nSo it’s currently getting this wrong. We need to add in a check to see if the year is divisible by 100 and set it to be labelled as not a leap year.\nHere we need to be careful as any number which is divisible by 100 is also divisible by 4 but we want a special thing to happen in the former case. The divisible-by-100 check is more specific than the divisible-by\\(4\\) check, so it must come first in the if-else if-else chain:\n\n\n\nleap_year.r\n\nyear &lt;- 2024\n\nif (year %% 100 == 0) {\n    cat(year, \"is not a leap year\")\n} else if (year %% 4 == 0) {\n    cat(year, \"is a leap year\")\n} else {\n    cat(year, \"is not a leap year\")\n}\n\n\n2024 is a leap year\n\n\n(omitting repeated code)\n\n\n2023 is not a leap year\n\n\n\n\n1900 is not a leap year\n\n\n\n\nDivisible by 400\nThe code is working for all those cases correctly, however, the last condition to think about is what happens for the year 2000:\n\n\n\nleap_year.r\n\nyear &lt;- 2000\n\nif (year %% 100 == 0) {\n    cat(year, \"is not a leap year\")\n} else if (year %% 4 == 0) {\n    cat(year, \"is a leap year\")\n} else {\n    cat(year, \"is not a leap year\")\n}\n\n\n2000 is not a leap year\n\n\nThis year should be a leap year as it is divisible by 400. Again this is more specific than the previous two so must be added before them in the chain:\n\n\n\nleap_year.r\n\nyear &lt;- 2024\n\nif (year %% 400 == 0) {\n    cat(year, \"is a leap year\")\n} else if (year %% 100 == 0) {\n    cat(year, \"is not a leap year\")\n} else if (year %% 4 == 0) {\n    cat(year, \"is a leap year\")\n} else {\n    cat(year, \"is not a leap year\")\n}\n\n\n2024 is a leap year\n\n\n(omitting repeated code)\n\n\n2023 is not a leap year\n\n\n\n\n1900 is not a leap year\n\n\n\n\n2000 is a leap year",

The easiest way to get access to R and RStudio is first downloading and installing the latest R version from https://cran.rstudio.com/, and after downloading and installing RStudio from https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/. You may need administrator access to install R and RStudio on your computer. Both tools are freely available for Windows, MacOS and Linux.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstallation on University managed computers\n\n\n\nIf you are using a University of Bristol computer, you will find R and RStudio in Company Portal.\n\n\nOnce both are installed, you can open RStudio and will look something like this:\n\nThe way that we will be setting up the space is to have a text editor on the top-left side of the screen and the R console on the bottom-left side. We’ll use the editor to write our code and the console to run it. On the right side we can keep other tabs open.\n\nWorking directory\nSetting up a working directory helps organize your project files and ensures that your code can find any necessary resources and dependencies. We will revisit this concept later on, but for now be mindful that the space where you save your scripts has to be the same than the working directory where R console and/or your Command Prompt/Terminal are working,\nIn R Console you can print the current working directory it with\ngetwd()\n\n\n[1] \"/Users/ab12345\"\n\n\nAlternatively, if you are using the Command Prompt (Windows) you can check your current directory with\n\n\nCommand Prompt\n\ncd\n\nOr if you are using a Terminal (MacOS and Linux) you can check your current directory with\n\n\nTerminal\n\npwd\n\nWe’re now ready to get started!",

The basic syntax in R which has a similar scaffolding to an if clause:\nwhile (condition) {\n    # code to execute while condition is True\n}\nTo ensure that the condition will eventually become FALSE, it is common usage to increment/decrement a counter variable in the loop body:\n\ncount &lt;- 0\nwhile ( count &lt; 5 ) {\n    cat(count, \" \")\n    count &lt;- count + 1\n}\n\n0  1  2  3  4  \n\n\nThere are some extra flow control instructions in while loops that we are not going to see here in detail but it is important to mention them. They are:\n\nbreak: exits the loop immediately\nnext: skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next\n\nwhile (TRUE) {\n    user_input &lt;- readline(\"Enter 'q' to quit: \")\n    if (user_input == 'q') {\n        break\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nGiven a list of students sorted by name\nstudents &lt;- c(\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\", \"Frank\", \"George\", \"Hannah\", \"Julia\", \"Mia\", \"Noah\", \"Olivia\")\ncreate a script while.R that prints the names of students starting with letters before ‘M’ in the alphabet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nNote in the below script that the while loop needs to take into account two different conditions:\n\nThat the student’s name starts with a letter before ‘M’\nThat we don’t try to index an element out of range in students\n\n\nstudents &lt;- c(\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\", \"Frank\", \"George\", \"Hannah\", \"Julia\", \"Mia\", \"Noah\", \"Olivia\")\n\n# Initialize the index\ni &lt;- 1\n\n# While loop to print names before 'M'\nwhile (i&lt;length(students) & students[i]&lt;\"M\") {\n    cat(students[i], \" \")\n    i &lt;- i + 1\n}\n\nAlice  Bob  Charlie  Frank  George  Hannah  Julia",

    "text": "It is possible to make R repeat certain lines of code using loops. The ability to run a line of code multiple times is the first large step on your road to making your code more structured and reusable.\nImagine we have three strings in a vector that we want to print. We could start by calling cat three times to create a program like:\nJean\n\n\nGolding\n\n\nInstitute\nThis printed the output we want. But you may feel that repeating the same call to cat is wasteful code, particularly if we want to repeat the same operation for many elements. If we can manage to write that line only once then we could save ourselves some typing and potentially make the code easier to read!\nWe can write a for loop in R which will perform a task once for each word in our vector:\nloop.R\n\nmy_words &lt;- c(\"Jean\", \"Golding\", \"Institute\")\n\nfor (word in my_words) {\n    cat(word, \" \")\n}\n\n\nJean  Golding  Institute\nEven in this tiny example, we have ve taken a script that was four lines of code and have reduced it to three lines, and more interestingly the same loop will work no matter how many items there are in the vector my_words.\nThis maps to real life where you may want, for example, to pay for each item on your shopping list. Another way of saying that could be “for each item on my shopping list, add its price to my total”, or as you would write that in R:\nIf we want to write more code after the end of a loop, we have to make sure that we have closed the curly braces. So this code will print:\nmy_words &lt;- c(\"Hello\", \"R\")\n\nfor (word in my_words) {\n    cat(word, \" \")\n}\n\nHello  R  \n\ncat(\"Goodbye \")\n\nGoodbye\nOn the contrary, the below code will print Goodbye in each iteration. This is because it was inside the body of the loop.\nmy_words &lt;- c(\"Hello\", \"R\")\n\nfor (word in my_words) {\n    cat(word, \" \")\ncat(\"Goodbye \")\n}\n\nHello  Goodbye R  Goodbye",

    "text": "Whenever solving a problem like this, it’s always good to build it up one step at a time. You could be tempted to jump right to the solution but it is easier to take small steps and check your results along the way than debugging a long piece of code.\n\nDivisible by 4\nThe first step is to implement the simplest of the logical checks: is the year divisible by 4? If it is, print out an appropriate message checking that it works for a know leap year.\n\n\n\nleap_year.r\n\nyear &lt;- 2024\n\nif (year %% 4 == 0) {\n    cat(year, \"is a leap year\")\n} \n\n\n2024 is a leap year\n\n\nFor a year that we know is not a leap year, what do we get:\n\n\n\nleap_year.r\n\nyear &lt;- 2023\n\nif (year %% 4 == 0) {\n    cat(year, \"is a leap year\")\n}\n\n\nWe get no output, so let’s fix that next, by adding an else:\n\n\n\nleap_year.r\n\nyear &lt;- 2024\n\nif (year %% 4 == 0) {\n    cat(year, \"is a leap year\")\n} else {\n    cat(year, \"is not a leap year\")\n}\n\n\n2024 is a leap year\n\n\n\n\n\nleap_year.r\n\nyear &lt;- 2023\n\nif (year %% 4 == 0) {\n    cat(year, \"is a leap year\")\n} else {\n    cat(year, \"is not a leap year\")\n}\n\n\n2023 is not a leap year\n\n\nSo far it’s looking like it’s doing the right thing. We have a working leap year calculator which covers most cases correctly.\n\n\nDivisible by 100\nLet’s check the next corner case: what happens if the year is divisible by 100. The rules say that this should not be a leap year:\n\n\n\nleap_year.r\n\nyear &lt;- 1900\n\nif (year %% 4 == 0) {\n    cat(year, \"is a leap year\")\n} else {\n    cat(year, \"is not a leap year\")\n}\n\n\n1900 is a leap year\n\n\nSo it’s currently getting this wrong. We need to add in a check to see if the year is divisible by 100 and set it to be labelled as not a leap year.\nHere we need to be careful as any number which is divisible by 100 is also divisible by 4 but we want a special thing to happen in the former case. The divisible-by-100 check is more specific than the divisible-by\\(4\\) check, so it must come first in the if-else if-else chain:\n\n\n\nleap_year.r\n\nyear &lt;- 2024\n\nif (year %% 100 == 0) {\n    cat(year, \"is not a leap year\")\n} else if (year %% 4 == 0) {\n    cat(year, \"is a leap year\")\n} else {\n    cat(year, \"is not a leap year\")\n}\n\n\n2024 is a leap year\n\n\n(omitting repeated code)\n\n\n2023 is not a leap year\n\n\n\n\n1900 is not a leap year\n\n\n\n\nDivisible by 400\nThe code is working for all those cases correctly, however, the last condition to think about is what happens for the year 2000:\n\n\n\nleap_year.r\n\nyear &lt;- 2000\n\nif (year %% 100 == 0) {\n    cat(year, \"is not a leap year\")\n} else if (year %% 4 == 0) {\n    cat(year, \"is a leap year\")\n} else {\n    cat(year, \"is not a leap year\")\n}\n\n\n2000 is not a leap year\n\n\nThis year should be a leap year as it is divisible by 400. Again this is more specific than the previous two so must be added before them in the chain:\n\n\n\nleap_year.r\n\nyear &lt;- 2024\n\nif (year %% 400 == 0) {\n    cat(year, \"is a leap year\")\n} else if (year %% 100 == 0) {\n    cat(year, \"is not a leap year\")\n} else if (year %% 4 == 0) {\n    cat(year, \"is a leap year\")\n} else {\n    cat(year, \"is not a leap year\")\n}\n\n\n2024 is a leap year\n\n\n(omitting repeated code)\n\n\n2023 is not a leap year\n\n\n\n\n1900 is not a leap year\n\n\n\n\n2000 is a leap year"

In other words, it allows humans to communicate with computers by providing a way for writing instructions that can be executed by a machine. This course is going to show you to give instructions to the computer to perform simple tasks and as you become more confident and follow the later courses, you will find that you are able to write much more complex applications.\nTo get started, you’ll need to install R and RStudio on your computer.

    "text": "We call variable to a symbolic name that refers to an object. They act as memory containers for storing data values and are created when you assign a value to them using the assignment operator &lt;- or =. For example, x &lt;- 5 assigns the integer value 5 to the variable x.\nThe value stored in a variable can change or vary throughout your program and can be any data type such as integers, strings, or lists. You will see different data types further in this section.\nname &lt;- \"Jean Golding\"\nage &lt;- 27\nweight &lt;- 76.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssigment operators\n\n\n\nIn R, both = and &lt;- can be used as assignment operators, but they have some subtle differences in usage.\n\nThe = operator is a general assignment operator in R and it’s more commonly used in function arguments and within function calls. mean(x = c(1, 2, 3))\nThe &lt;- operator is the traditional and preferred assignment operator in R and has a higher precedence than =, which can be important in some contexts. x &lt;- 5\n\n\n\nChosing the correct name for a particular variable is an important task as a non-descriptive name (or worse, an incorrect name) will be very confusing for you and anyone reading your code. For instance, for a variable which contains a number representing a distance in miles, avoid shortened names like dm, distm or d and instead use a name like distance_miles. Remember, code will be written once but read many times so make it easy to read.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable names\n\n\n\nWhen naming variables in R, there are specific rules to follow:\n\nVariable names can include letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits, periods (.) and underscores (_), but they cannot start with a digit or underscore. Examples of valid variable names include my_var and var_2; invalid examples would be 2var (starts with a digit) or my-var (contains a hyphen).\nVariable names are case-sensitive, meaning myVariable, MyVariable, and MYVARIABLE would be considered different variables.",

    "text": "Earlier you were told that R will read your script starting at the top and running each line of code until it reaches the bottom. While largely true, real code will use control structures to create dynamic and structured programs capable of handling complex tasks while keeping the code more readable and understandable, which is crucial for collaboration, maintenance, and debugging.\n\n\n\nAdapted from: This Is A Book, by Demetri Martin\n\n\nImagine that you want to process your data in different ways depending if your samples are above or not of a certain value, for example:\nLOOP FOR EACH sample IN my_study\n    IF  sample value &gt; 100\n        DO SOMETHING\n    OTHERWISE\n        DO SOMETHING ELSE\nIn essence, control structures are fundamental building blocks that enable programmers to create logically structured programs. Flow control structures, such as if, allow programmers to dictate the order and conditions under which specific instructions are executed within a program. Looping structures, such as for and while, enable the repetition of code blocks, which is crucial for tasks that require iterating through data performing calculations multiple items.",
